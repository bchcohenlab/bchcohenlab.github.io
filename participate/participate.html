            <h2>The Neuroanatomical Basis for Face Processing Deficits in Autism</h2>
            <h4><i>We are currently seeking participants with and without autism for a study on face processing and recognition.</i></h4>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>Why are we studying this?</strong></h3>
            <p>Some individuals with autism have difficulties related to face processing and recognition, which can have substantial effects on everyday life. For this study, we hope to figure out where these face processing difficulties arise in the brain. This research could help us provide targets for treatment and could aid in the development of biomarkers for future detection.</p>
